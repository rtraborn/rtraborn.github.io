I am an Assistant Research Scientist in Mike Lynch's lab in the [Biodesign Institute](https://biodesign.asu.edu/) [Center for Mechanisms of Evolution](https://biodesign.asu.edu/research/centers/mechanisms-evolution#:~:text=The%20Biodesign%20Center%20for%20Mechanisms,the%20building%20blocks%20of%20cells.&text=In%20essence%2C%20we%20are%20aiming,field%20called%20evolutionary%20cell%20biology.)

## About my research

My work in principally focused on *cis*-regulatory regions in eukaryotic genomes, particularly promoter architecture and evolution. I am currently working on several projects in this area.

- Promoter evolution after whole-genome duplication, using the *Paramecium aurelia* species complex).
- *Cis*-regulatory sequence differences in populations, using the model system *Daphnia pulex*.
- Modeling the shape properties of promoters across eukaryotes.
